**Cubian** is a Linux operating system designed for [Cubieboard 1](http://cubieboard.org/) based on [Debian wheezy](http://www.debian.org/News/2013/20130504).  
[Cubian](http://cubian.org) is the minimal version with customization which include but not limited to:

1. Cubieboard bootup Logo
2. Build with the latest stable Kernel (version 3.4.43)
3. Include RTL8188EU driver (mercury mw150us use this chip)
4. The easiest NAND installation ever
5. Onboard LEDS show the IP address through [Morse code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) (you don't need a HDMI screen neither USB-TTL cable and Router's admin privileges to start play cubieboard)
6. Network and System status indicator using onboard LED
7. Preconfigured swap area (increase the amount of available memory)
8. Basic SSH security config
9. Battery included (various utilities were pre-installed like VIM etc.)
